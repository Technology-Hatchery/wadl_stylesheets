<p>CORBA has IDL; SOAP has WSDL. Developers often ask for similar 
capabilites for HTTP-based, "RESTful" services. While WSDL does claim
support for HTTP,  isn't well-positioned
to take advantage of HTTP's features, nor to encourage good practice.</p>

<p>There are a lot of proposals in this space, but 
<a href="http://wadl.dev.java.net/">WADL</a> is the most mature
and capable. More thoughts 
<a href="http://www.mnot.net/blog/2005/05/18/WADL">here</a>.</p>

<p><a href="wadl_documentation.xsl">wadl_documentation.xsl</a> is
an XSL stylesheet that transforms WADL into human-readable documentation, 
one of many <a href="http://www.mnot.net/blog/2004/06/14/desc_usecases">uses 
of a Web description format</a>.</p>

<p>Note that <a href="http://www.exslt.org/exsl/functions/node-set/" class="offsite">EXSLT node-set</a> support is required,
so this stylesheet will not work natively in some browsers. Try 
<a href="http://saxon.sourceforge.net/" class="offsite">Saxon</a> or <a href="http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/xsltproc.html" class="offsite">xsltproc</a>.</p>

<p><a href="uri.xsd">uri.xsd</a> is a library of XML type restrictions 
that correspond to different components of a URI, so they can be accurately described (e.g., in a WADL <tt>param</tt> element).</p>
